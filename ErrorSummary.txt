Error Summary - October 14, 2021

MACS3 was tested on the local version of GenePattern with the added Dockerfile, Manifest, and input data, where the BAM file containing "ChIP" is the input treatment file and "CTRL" is the optional control file.

1. Conflicting Optional Args
    On the local GenePattern, when parameters are marked as "Optional", they are still read as "Required" Parameters when trying to run the module.
    To resolve "Optional" parameters, default values are set. This overrides MACS3 module from automatically determining parameters (such as tag size) when there is no parameter.
    Some conflicts with MACS3 running as some optional parameters cannot be run at the same time.

2. Input Test File Data led to Parameter Errors
    Due to some optional paramters conflicting, I started the input data with just the required argument. Each time it was ran, an error would pop up requiring an optional parameter to avoid the error.
    Treatment, Control, Format, and TagSize were the optional parameters I was able to add through this step-by-step process based on Error Messages output by MACS3.
    Stopped at the error occurring in line 70 of callpeak_cmd.py "(treat,control) = load_tag_files_options (options)" where it is not know which parameter is needed to continue, as "options" denotes all parameters.
    Error printed: "struct.error: unpack requires a buffer of 4 bytes"
